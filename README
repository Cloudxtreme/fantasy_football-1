Fantasy Football on Glass

Fantasy Football on Glass scrapes the Yahoo Fantasy Football API to get real time stats for the leagues you input. You'll get timeline cards added to your Glass any time a player scores.

Todo:
* Let you put in leagues instead of individual players, and automatically scrape them.
* Allow other notification styles
* Give notifications throughout the week with notes from ESPN Fantasy news and other sources about your players
* Give you a heads up when your players are going into bye weeks, injured, etc.
* Get league specific stats (actual points instead of just touchdowns, matchups, whether you're winning, etc)
